# 008 - Add Important Dates Feature
Date: 2025-01-17
Type: Feature

## What I Built
- Added "Important Dates" extraction to meeting analysis
- New field captures all significant dates mentioned in transcripts
- Includes future milestones, deadlines, scheduled events, review cycles, and historical references
- Positioned after core analysis sections but before "Next Steps"

## Key Decisions
- Named it "Important Dates" (not "Dates & Other") to maintain focus
- Decided against "Other" section to avoid redundancy with existing fields
- Will extract dates with context (e.g., "March 15: MVP launch target")
- Includes recurring dates and date ranges
- Works for both business meetings and training lectures

## Code Locations
- `/api/analyze.js`: Updated system prompt to extract important_dates
- `/api/analyze.js`: Added important_dates to output structure
- `/index.html`: Added Important Dates tab for business meetings
- `/index.html`: Added Important Dates to export functionality

## Testing Notes
- Test with transcripts containing various date formats
- Verify dates are extracted with proper context
- Ensure no duplicate information with action_items or next_steps
- Check that existing functionality remains intact
- Test both Gemini Flash and Pro models

## Next Steps
- Monitor if date extraction quality varies between models
- Consider adding date formatting standardization
- Potentially add calendar export functionality in future
